========= LIST OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CODE =========

The following roadmap is a "guesstimate", an estimate based
on a mixture of guesswork and calculation.

It reflects the following experiences and assumptions:

   a) Reconciling the 256-color capability with the 256-
      color pair limit took many months, experiments and
      advancements by various GNU/Linux operating system
      providers.

   b) Several attempts to resolve the GUI object focus con-
      trol have been unsuccessful.

   c) Resolving the keyboard shortcut key capability needed
      for vt100 terminal support without a mouse has been
      relegated to the lowest priority pending any known
      user interest.
