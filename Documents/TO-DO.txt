========= LIST OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CODE =========

The following roadmap is a "guesstimate", an estimate based
on a mixture of guesswork and calculation.

It reflects the following experiences and assumptions:

   a) Reconciling the 256-color capability with the 256-
      color pair limit took many months, experiments and
      advancements by various GNU/Linux operating system
      providers.

   b) Several attempts to resolve the GUI object focus con-
      trol have been unsuccessful.

   c) Resolving the keyboard shortcut key capability needed
      for vt100 terminal support without a mouse has been
      relegated to the lowest priority pending any known
      user interest.

7. Prospective Toolkit User Comments

       Group.

       1. """
          I would recommend not being too ambitious about
          multi-version support.  If you support 2.6, 2.7,
          3.3, 3.4, and 3.5, you have covered 99.9% of the
          Python users, and have a lot of common syntax to
          use.  In particular, you can say "except Exception
          as e", and get rid of most of the differences
          between your py2 and py3 code.
          """

          [Richard S. Gordon

          Experimentation determined that in fact recent
          Python 2.7 applications can successfully use the
          Python 3.4.3 Toolkit components. However, the
          Python 2x Toolkit is being maintained to:

          1) facilitate backporting by other users; and

          2) insulate Python 2x Toolkit users from incompat-
             ible changes to the future Python 3.5 Toolkit.
          ]

      2.  """
          There's no need to maintain different copies of
          the code. You can do all this with a single ver-
          sion, so that you don't have to copy changes
          around.  For other differences between python 2
          and python 3, you can use the "six" module, which
          is design[sic ed] to help bridge the differences.
          """

          [Richard S. Gordon

          Interesting technology that will require consid-
          erable experimentation before adoption, on com-
          puter platforms that are no longer readily avail-
          able. For example, when I could not find pre-built
          Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Linux versions of Python:

             1.6.1,

             2.0.1. 2.1.3, 2.2.1, 2.3.7, 2.4.6, 2.5.3,
             2.6.8, 2.7.9,

             3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.1.3, 3.2.4, 3.3.0, 3.4.3,
             3.5.0a2

          I attempted to build them using the supplied con-
          figure and make scripts.

          They built and worked in Command Line Interface
          mode. But the Toolkit's Python 2.7 programming
          language syntax, synatics and Global Module Index
          became less and less compatible as I went backward
          from Python 2.5.3 to 1.6.1.

          The Curses Graphical User Interface mode, on the
          other hand, failed to build and I didn't have the
          expertise and time to research and resolve the
          build issues. I suspected that the Ubuntu 14.04
          LTS Linux curses library also differed signifi-
          cantly from its older counterparts.
