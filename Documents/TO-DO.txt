   platforms with:

   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-

     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2
     or earlier GUI applications and character-mode 16-/8-

========= LIST OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CODE =========

The following roadmap is a "guesstimate", an estimate based
on a mixture of guesswork and calculation.

It reflects the following experiences and assumptions:

   a) Reconciling the 256-color capability with the 256-
      color pair limit took many months, experiments and
      advancements by various GNU/Linux operating system
      providers.

      NCurses 6.0 Release Announcement, 8 August 2015
      (Excerpt from http://invisible-island.net/):

      "This release is designed to be source-compatible with
      ncurses 5.0 through 5.9; providing a new application
      binary interface (ABI). Although the source can still
      be configured to support the ncurses 5 ABI, the intent
      of the release is to provide extensions which are
      generally useful, but binary-incompatible with ncurses 5:

      Extend the cchar_t structure to allow more than 16 colors
      to be encoded.

      Modify the encoding of mouse state to make room for a 5th
      mouse button. That allows one to use ncurses with a wheel
      mouse with xterm or similar X terminal emulators...."

      NOTES:

         (1) The Python Software Foundation plans to support
             more than 16 colors (requires 64-bit processor
             operating in 64-bit mode) [and wheel mouse]
             beginning with Python 3.6.0. It plans to NEVER
             retrofit 64-bit ncurses 6.x features to any
             Python 2.0-2.7 or Python 3.0-3.5 release.

         (2) The Python Software Foundation has NOT announced
             plans to upgrade its Standard Python Curses Module
             to support the full nCurses 6.0 Application
             Programming Interface (API).

   b) Several attempts to resolve the GUI object focus con-
      trol have been unsuccessful.

      On 19 Jan. 2017, came across an nCurses document,
      "ncurses-6.0/doc/ncurses-intro.doc", which contains a
      discussion under the heading "Refresh of Overlapping
      Windows" which might explain the failure of focus
      issue and lead to its resolution.

   c) Resolving the keyboard shortcut key capability needed
      for vt100 terminal support without a mouse has been
      relegated to the lowest priority pending any known
      user interest.

7. Prospective Toolkit User Comments

       Group.

       1. """
          I would recommend not being too ambitious about
          multi-version support.  If you support 2.6, 2.7,
          3.3, 3.4, and 3.5, you have covered 99.9% of the
          Python users, and have a lot of common syntax to
          use.  In particular, you can say "except Exception
          as e", and get rid of most of the differences
          between your py2 and py3 code.
          """

          [Richard S. Gordon

          Experimentation determined that in fact recent
          Python 2.7 applications can successfully use the
          Python 3.4.3 Toolkit components. However, the
          Python 2x Toolkit is being maintained to:

          1) facilitate backporting by other users; and

          2) insulate Python 2x Toolkit users from incompat-
             ible changes to the future Python 3.5 Toolkit.
          ]

      2.  """
          There's no need to maintain different copies of
          the code. You can do all this with a single ver-
          sion, so that you don't have to copy changes
          around.  For other differences between python 2
          and python 3, you can use the "six" module, which
          is design[sic ed] to help bridge the differences.
          """

          [Richard S. Gordon

          Interesting technology that will require consid-
          erable experimentation before adoption, on com-
          puter platforms that are no longer readily avail-
          able. For example, when I could not find pre-built
          Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Linux versions of Python:

             1.6.1,

             2.0.1. 2.1.3, 2.2.1, 2.3.7, 2.4.6, 2.5.3,
             2.6.8, 2.7.9,

             3.0.0, 3.0.1, 3.1.3, 3.2.4, 3.3.0, 3.4.3,
             3.5.0a2

          I attempted to build them using the supplied con-
          figure and make scripts.

          They built and worked in Command Line Interface
          mode. But the Toolkit's Python 2.7 programming
          language syntax, synatics and Global Module Index
          became less and less compatible as I went backward
          from Python 2.5.3 to 1.6.1.

          The Curses Graphical User Interface mode, on the
          other hand, failed to build and I didn't have the
          expertise and time to research and resolve the
          build issues. I suspected that the Ubuntu 14.04
          LTS Linux curses library also differed signifi-
          cantly from its older counterparts.
