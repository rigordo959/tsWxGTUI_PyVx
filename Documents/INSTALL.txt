             via:

             "tar xvzf ./tsWxGTUI_PyVx_Repository_0.0.0.tgz"

          b. From "zip" file via "bash" shell command on
             Cygwin (free Linux-like Microsoft Windows
             plug-in from Red Hat), Linux, OS X or Unix
             via:

             "unzip ./tsWxGTUI_PyVx_Repository_0.0.0.zip"

          c. From "zip" file via "Command Prompt" shell com-
             mand on Microsoft Windows using an equivalent
             third-party tool via:
