======================== DEFINITIONS =======================

    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

    "Copyright is a legal concept, enacted by most govern-
    ments, giving the creator of an original work exclusive
    rights to it, usually for a limited time, with the
    intention of enabling the creator of intellectual
    wealth (e.g. the photographer of a photograph or the
    author of a book) to get compensated for their work
    and be able to financially support themselves.
    Generally, it is "the right to copy", but also gives
    the copyright holder the right to be credited for the
    work, to determine who may adapt the work to other
    forms, who may perform the work, who may financially
    benefit from it, and other related rights.
    It is a form of intellectual property (like the patent,
    the trademark, and the trade secret) applicable to any
    expressible form of an idea or information that is sub-
    stantive and discrete.[1]

    Copyright initially was conceived as a way for govern-
    ment to restrict printing; the contemporary intent of
    copyright is to promote the creation of new works by
    giving authors control of and profit from them. Copy-
    rights are said to be territorial, which means that
    they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific
    state unless that state is a party to an international
    agreement. Today, however, this is less relevant since
    most countries are parties to at least one such agree-
    ment. While many aspects of national copyright laws
    have been standardized through international copyright
    agreements, copyright laws of most countries have some
    unique features.[2] Typically, the duration of copyright
    is the whole life of the creator plus fifty to a hundred
    years from the creator's death, or a finite period for
    anonymous or corporate creations. Some jurisdictions
    have required formalities to establishing copyright,
    but most recognize copyright in any completed work,
    without formal registration. Generally, copyright is
    enforced as a civil matter, though some jurisdictions
    do apply criminal sanctions.

    Most jurisdictions recognize copyright limitations,
    allowing "fair" exceptions to the creator's exclu-
    sivity of copyright, and giving users certain rights.
    The development of digital media and computer network
    technologies have prompted reinterpretation of these
    exceptions, introduced new difficulties in enforcing
    copyright, and inspired additional challenges to copy-
    right law's philosophic basis. Simultaneously, busi-
    nesses with great economic dependence upon copyright
    have advocated the extension and expansion of their
    intellectual property rights, and sought additional
    legal and technological enforcement."
