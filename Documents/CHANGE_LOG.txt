   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling

   (vt100-family) terminals and terminal emulators.

   You can find this and other plain-text files in the
   Toolkit subdirectory named:

======================= Change Log =========================

  2013/10/21 rsg Added tsCxGlobals to tsLibCLI. It establishes
                 configuration constants and macro-type functions
                 for the Command Line Interface mode of the
                 "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit.

  2013/10/18 rsg Added tsGistGetTerminalSize.py module to the
                 tsUtilities package and to the configuration
                 gathering of the tsPlatformRuntimeEnvironment
                 package. It captures, reports and displays the
                 command line shell window size on Cygwin, Linux,
                 Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Unix.

  2013/10/18 rsg Added logic to the tsApplication module to gather,
                 capture and log the tsPlatformRuntimeEnvironment
                 at each Python application launch in a manner
                 similar to the capture of GUI configuration by
                 the tsWxGraphicalTextUserInterface module at GUI
                 launch.

  2014/03/14 rsg Added MANIFEST.in to distribution and installation
                 setup that includes non-python files.

  2014/04/04 rsg Added MANIFEST_TREE.sh to distribution and instal-
                 lation setup to generate text and html versions
                 of file manifest listing.

  2014/04/05 rsg Removed deprecated packages and tools:

                 tsCommandLineParserPkg
                 tsConfigObjectPkg
                 tsDataBasePkg
                 tsDecoratorPkg
                 tsLibraryImport Tool
                 tsLinesOfCode Tool
                 tsPublish Tool
                 tsReImport Tool
                 tsReVersion Tool
                 tsThreadPoolPkg

  2014/11/21 rsg Resolved display anomaly issue with xterm-88color
                 and xterm-256color by application of the config-
                 uration control switch USE_256_COLOR_PAIR_LIMIT
                 so that these terminal emulators now behave like
                 their xterm-16color counterpart. This color pair
                 limitation technique was discovered in such
                 newer operating system releases as CentOS 7.0
                 Linux and Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).

  2015/03/26 rsg Successfully ported copies of current
                 developer-sandboxes into installable site-
                 packages. Changes involved the tedious
                 tasks of:

                 a) Moving hundreds of building-block, tool
                    and test source code from separate devel-
                    oper-sandbox packages into appropriate
                    tsLibCLI, tsToolsCLI, tsToolsLibCLI,
                    tsLibGUI, tsToolsGUI and tsToolsLibGUI
                    site-package directories;

                 b) Editing hundreds of source code files to 
                    replace "try-except" logic around import
                    statements with "import from" site-pack-
                    age logic and substitute empty site-
                    package "__init__.py" files for complex
                    path generating logic in dozens of de-
                    veloper-packages.

                 c) Installing and debugging each site-
                    package on various host platforms.

                 d) Updating documentation to reflect both
                    the developer-sandbox and site-package
                    configurations.

    2015/06/23 rsg Modified "tsWxEventLoop" module to take
                   advantage of a recently discovered
                   "nCurses" feature that makes mouse input
                   available not just for xterm-family term-
                   inal emulators but also with vt100-family
                   ones, but only with the new "XTerm" and
                   "UXTerm" terminal application on Linux
                   operating system and with the "mintty"
                   terminal application on the Linux-based
                   Cygwin plugin for Microsoft Windows.

                   This eliminates the need for keyboard
                   shortcut "hot" key feature which is still
                   to be developed. However, processing
                   twelve instead of a single mouse input
                   event introduces a noticable delay in
                   response and precludes use of double or
                   triple button clicks.
