   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling on
   platforms with:

   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2
     or earlier GUI applications and character-mode 16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

==================== CURRENT LIMITATIONS ===================

This section details the limitations of the functional,
interface, design, implementation, operation, quality and
reliability goals.

1. Known "nCurses"-based, "wxPython" Emulation Limitations

   a. Supports typical nCurses platforms with keyboard,
      mouse and only 8-/16 color display terminal or term-
      inal emulator despite some older host-specific curses
      implementation reports of 88/256 available colors and
      7744/32768 color pairs.

   b. Supports typical nCurses platforms with keyboard, mouse
      and 1-color phosphor display terminal or vt100 and
      vt220 terminal emulator despite some older host-spe-
      cific curses implementation reports of no mouse.
      However, unlike the xterm mouse, the synthesized
      vt100/vt220 mouse can recognize only single mouse
      button clicks but not double or triple ones.

   c. Bit-mapped images are NOT supported except for the
      prerecorded one used at startup as a Splash screen.

   d. Maps wxPython-style pixel dimensions into/from nCurses
      character row and column cell units (emulation assumes
      character cell equivalent pixel dimensions are 8 width
      x 12 height). The operator must therefor manually con-
      figure the terminal window to either use smaller fonts
      or a larger window.

   e. Supports the operator selected terminal/terminal
      emulator fixed font with the blink, bold, dim,
      normal, reverse, standout and underline attribute
      changed/restored by the application as appropriate.
      However, not all host operating system platforms
      actually blink and some change colors instead.

   f. Unverified support for nCurses platforms with key-
      board, mouse and 256-color display terminal or
      xterm_256color terminal emulator when control switch
      to "USE_256_COLOR_PAIR_LIMIT" is deactivated.

   g. Automatically maps 68-color, "wxPython" palette only
      into available nCurses 8-/16-color xterm palette.

   h. Automatically maps 68-color, "wxPython" palette only
      into available nCurses 2-color vt100/vt220 palette.

2. Known "wxPython" Emulation Issues

   a. Mouse Event handling is rudimentary but suitable for
      left/middle/right button click, double-click use.

   b. Queued GUI and non-GUI event processing is non-func-
      tional while under development.

   c. Frame / Dialog closing/resizing/deleting is is non-
      functional while under development.

   d. Frame / Dialog overlay stacking/hiding/unhiding is
      non-functional while under development.

   e. Dialog user keyboard input processing is not recom-
      mended while under development.

   f. Linux host platform-specific exceptions during the
      determination of which GUI scrollbar object may
      intermittantly occur with mouse clicks.
