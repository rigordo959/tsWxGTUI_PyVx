========================= PURPOSE ==========================

The "tsWxGTUI" Toolkit provides a collection of building-
block components, tools, utilities, and tests for creating,
enhancing, troubleshooting, maintaining and supporting
application programs that are suitable for embedded systems.

1. Application Programs

    Automation, communication, control, diagnostic, in-
    strumentation and simulation application programs
    typically require an "operator-friendly" Command Line
    Interface (CLI) or a Graphical-style User Interface
    (GUI) that can be monitored and controlled locally or
    remotely.

2. Development Systems

   General-purpose systems used for development of:

   a. software (source code for libraries of scripts,
      building blocks, tools and applications)

   b. documentation (presentations, training material,
      programmer reference manuals etc.)

   Such general-purpose desktop, laptop and workstation
   computer systems typically have upgradable or at least
   sufficient processing, memory, communication, input/
   output and file storage resources. They typically have
   computer terminal interface hardware suitable for a
   pixel-mode display that also supports character-mode. 

3. Embedded Systems

   Mission-critical systems used to monitor and control:

   a. operating mode (setup, diagnostic/test, monitor
      only, manual, automatic etc.)

   b. setpoints (startup/shutdown sequences, tempera-
      tures, pressures, motion speed, fluid/gas flows,
      lighting brightness/contrast, sound loudness/tonal
      balance, detector sensitivity etc.)

   c. commercial, industrial, manufacturing, medical or
      military equipment.

   Such application-specific computer systems typically have
   upgradable but limited processing, memory, communication,
   input/output and file storage resources. Some may have
   character-mode hardware only suitable for their operating
   system's command line console.
