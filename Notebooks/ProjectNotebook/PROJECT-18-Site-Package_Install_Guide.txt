   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling on
   platforms with:

   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2
     or earlier GUI applications and character-mode 16-/8-

================ Site-Package Install Guide ================

1. Site Package Installation Guide:

   Upon downloading and then extracting the contents of the
   TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit "tar" or "zip" file,
   the recipient will find both "Developer-Sandbox" and
   "Site-Package" versions for Python 2x and Python 3x.

   WARNING: The repository contains site-packages but is NOT
            itself one.

            The recipient must NOT attempt to install the
            entire repository with any other Python version
            specific site-packages.

   1.1 Python Version Specific Site-Package Install

       You must use the Python Version Specific command
       for each version you intend to install.

       WARNING: Once you have installed one of the included
                site-packages, you will not be able to use
                or debug those components which you have
                modified but not yet installed.

       1.1.1 Python 2x Install Examples

             # Command must actually be on a single line
             cd ./SourceDistributions/
                  Site-Packages/tsWxGTUI_PyVx/Python-2x

             a. python2.6 setup.py install

             b. python2.7 setup.py install

       1.1.2 Python 3x Install Examples

             # Command must actually be on a single line
             cd ./SourceDistributions/
                  Site-Packages/tsWxGTUI_PyVx/Python-3x

             a. python3.2 setup.py install

             b. python3.4 setup.py install

   1.2 Python Version Specific Site-Package Test

       You must use the Python Version Specific command
       for each version you intend to test.

       1.2.1 Python 2x Test Examples

                  Python-2x/tsWxGTUI_Py2x

             # Copy collection of tests into top-level
             # directory containing toolkit libraries
             cp -p ./tsDemoArchive/src/test_*.py .

             # Run one of the Command Line Interface tests
             # using python, python2, python2.6 or python2.7
             # as appropriate
             a. python test_tsPlatformRunTimeEnvironment.py

             # Run one of the Graphical User Interface tests
             # using python, python2, python2.6 or python2.7
             # as appropriate
             b. python test_tsWxSystemSettings.py

             # Run another Graphical User Interface test
             # using python, python2, python2.6 or python2.7
             # as appropriate
             c. python test_tsWxColorPalette.py

       1.2.2 Python 3x Test Examples

             # Set path to top-level directory containing
             # toolkit libraries
             cd ./SourceDistributions/
                  Developer-Sandboxes/tsWxGTUI_PyVx/
                  Python-3x/tsWxGTUI_Py3x

             # Copy collection of tests into top-level
             # directory containing toolkit libraries
             cp -p ./tsDemoArchive/src/test_*.py .

             # Run one of the Command Line Interface tests
             # using python3, python3.2 or python3.4
             # as appropriate
             a. python3 test_tsPlatformRunTimeEnvironment.py

             # Run one of the Graphical User Interface tests
             # using python3, python3.2 or python3.4
             # as appropriate
             b. python3 test_tsWxSystemSettings.py

             # Run another Graphical User Interface test
             # using python3, python3.2 or python3.4
             # as appropriate
