   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2

=========== Developer-Sandbox Installation Guide ===========

1. Developer-Sandbox Install Guide:

   Upon downloading and then extracting the contents of the
   TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit "tar" or "zip" file,
   the recipient will find both "Developer-Sandbox" and
   "Site-Package" versions for Python 2x and Python 3x.

   WARNING: The repository contains both Developer-Sandboxes
            and Site-Packages but is NOT itself either one.

            Developer-Sandboxes are used in the location
            assigned by their location in the "tar" or "zip"
            file extraction.

            The recipient must NOT attempt to install the
            entire repository or any Developer-Sandbox with
            any other Python version specific Site-Packages.

   1.1 Python Version Specific Developer-Sandbox Test

       You must use the Python Version Specific command
       for each version you extracted.

       1.1.1 Python 2x Test Examples

             # Set path to top-level directory containing
             # toolkit libraries
             cd ./SourceDistributions/
                  Developer-Sandboxes/tsWxGTUI_PyVx/
                  Python-2x/tsWxGTUI_Py2x

             # Copy collection of tests into top-level
             # directory containing toolkit libraries
             cp -p ./tsDemoArchive/src/test_*.py .

             # Run one of the Command Line Interface tests
             # using python, python2, python2.6 or python2.7
             # as appropriate
             a. python2 test_tsPlatformRunTimeEnvironment.py

             # Run one of the Graphical User Interface tests
             # using python, python2, python2.6 or python2.7
             # as appropriate
             b. python2 test_tsWxSystemSettings.py

             # Run another Graphical User Interface test
             # using python, python2, python2.6 or python2.7
             # as appropriate
             c. python2 test_tsWxColorPalette.py

       1.1.2 Python 3x Test Examples

             # Set path to top-level directory containing
             # toolkit libraries
             cd ./SourceDistributions/
                  Developer-Sandboxes/tsWxGTUI_PyVx/
                  Python-3x/tsWxGTUI_Py3x

             # Copy collection of tests into top-level
             # directory containing toolkit libraries
             cp -p ./tsDemoArchive/src/test_*.py .

             # Run one of the Command Line Interface tests
             # using python3, python3.2 or python3.4
             # as appropriate
             a. python3 test_tsPlatformRunTimeEnvironment.py

             # Run one of the Graphical User Interface tests
             # using python3, python3.2 or python3.4
             # as appropriate
             b. python3 test_tsWxSystemSettings.py

             # Run another Graphical User Interface test
             # using python3, python3.2 or python3.4
             # as appropriate
