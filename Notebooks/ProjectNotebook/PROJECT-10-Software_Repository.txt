=================== "Software Repository ===================

   Excerpt From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

   "A software repository is a storage location from which
   software packages may be retrieved and installed on a
   computer."

   This is the repository for the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx"
   Toolkit. It is the collection of documentation and com-
   puter program source code files that is being distributed
   by its author in order to publish and share the intellec-
   tual property with others.

   It contains the following subdirectories and files:

<Your Working Repository>
(e.g. "tsWxGTUI_PyVx_Repository") 
  |
  |  Working repository containing directories and
  |  files to be packaged into downloadable "tarball"
  |  and/or "zip" files via the commands:
  |
  +-- ["Documents"]
  |     |
  |     |  This directory contains a collection of files
  |     |  which provide the Toolkit recipient with an
  |     |  understanding of the purpose, goals & capabil-
  |     |  ities, non-goals & limitations, terms & condi-
  |     |  tions and procedures for installing, operating,
  |     |  modifying and redistributing the Toolkit. 
  |     |
  |     +-- "README3-Documents.txt"
  |
  +-- ["ManPages"]
  |     |
  |     |  Deliverable Toolkit manual pages are a
  |     |  form of online software documentation
  |     |  usually found on a Unix or Unix-like
  |     |  operating system.
  |     |
  |     |  Topics covered include computer programs
  |     |  (including library and system calls),
  |     |  formal standards and conventions, and even
  |     |  abstract concepts.
  |     |
  |     +-- "README4-ManPages.txt"
  |
  +-- ["Notebooks"]
  |     |
  |     |  Contains a collection of commentaries that
  |     |  express opinions or offerings of explana-
  |     |  tions about events or situations that might
  |     |  be useful to Toolkit installers, developers,
  |     |  operators, troubleshooters and distributors.
  |     |  The documents may be in Application-specific
  |     |  formats (such as Adobe PDF, JPEG Bit-mapped
  |     |  image, LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, plain
  |     |  text).
  |     |
  |     +-- "README5-Notebooks.txt"
  |
  +-- ["SourceDistributions"]
  |     |
  |     |  Contains a collection of computer program
  |     |  source code files that the Toolkit recip-
  |     |  ient will need to install, operate, modify
  |     |  and re-distribute the Toolkit.
  |     |
  |     +-- ["Developer-Sandbox"]
  |     |     |
  |     |     |  A sandbox is a testing environment that iso-
  |     |     |  lates untested code changes and outright
  |     |     |  experimentation from the production environ-
  |     |     |  ment or repository.
  |     |     |
  |     |     +-- "README7-DeveloperSandboxes.txt"
  |     |
  |     +-- ["Site-Package"]
  |     |     |
  |     |     |  Site-packages is the location where third-
  |     |     |  party packages are installed (i.e., those
  |     |     |  not part of the core Python distribution).
  |     |     |  NOTE: That with Linux, Mac OS X and Unix
  |     |     |  operating systems one must have root priv-
  |     |     |  iledges to write to that location.
