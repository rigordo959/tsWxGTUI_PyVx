Enhancement to eliminate overhead during handling of scroll arrow events.
Current design practice features multiple layers of GUI objects which each
create event bindings that must be searched for a connection between triggering
object and ultimate recipient. Current workaround requires elaborate callback
mechanism. Propose revision eliminates intermediate layer bindings and associate
searches.

Enhancement to add popup menu to taskbar button with appropriate option choices.
Activate/cancel frame/dialog iconize, resize/restore frame/dialog size, close
frame/dialog in manner similar to Microsoft Windows, Linux or Unix.
Comment 1 admin 2015-06-14 04:57:07 EDT
The enhancement would provide a flexible means of handling or recovering from an
iconization which had hidden (rather than re-sized) the frame or dialog and
associated child GUI objects. The alternative to the enhancement is to assume
that hiding had been used and that clicking on a specific taskbar button should
cancel it if hiding was active or else resize it to its previous size.

move-paste and copy-move-paste involves the following operator actions: mouse
button press, mouse move, mouse button release. Current xterm design only

clicks.

The curses.textpad module provides a Textbox class that handles elementary text
editing in a curses window, supporting a set of keybindings resembling those of
Emacs (thus, also of Netscape Navigator, BBedit 6.x, FrameMaker, and many other
programs). The module also provides a rectangle-drawing function useful for
framing text boxes or for other purposes.

Unfortunately, its use within the wxPython emulation suspends updates to other
wxPython GUI objects.

An attempt to substitute a character input event driven emulation is too slow,
unresponsive and buggy.
Bug 44
 Summary:   The character input event driven curses.textpad emulation is too
           slow, unresponsive and buggy.
