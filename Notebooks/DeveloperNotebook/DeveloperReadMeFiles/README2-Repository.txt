   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling
   on character-mode 8-/16-color (xterm-family) & non-color
   (vt100-family) terminals and terminal emulators.

   You can find this and other plain-text files in the
   Toolkit subdirectory named:

       "./<Toolkit Recipient's Repository>/Documents".

         |     |  usually found on a Unix or Unix-like
         |     |  operating system.

         |     |
         |     |  Unlike their Unix or Unix-like counterparts,
         |     |  a Toolkit user may NOT invoke a man page by
         |     |  issuing the "man command". Instead, a user
         |     |  mmust display a man page by issuing the
         |     |  "less <man document file>" command.

======================== Repository ========================

1. Repository

   Excerpt From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

   "A software repository is a storage location from which
   software packages may be retrieved and installed on a
   computer."

   This is the repository for the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx"
   Toolkit. It is the collection of documentation and com-
   puter program source code files that is being distributed
   by its author in order to publish and share the intellec-
   tual property with others.

   It contains the following subdirectories and files:

   1.1 Documents

       Contains introductory and other training information
       for installers, developers, operators, troubleshoot-
       ers and distributors.

       Toolkit software documentation is written in plain
       text that accompanies computer software. It either
       explains how it operates or how to use it, and
       may mean different things to people in different
       roles. Types of software documentation include:

       a) Requirements - Statements that identify attri-
          butes, capabilities, characteristics, or qual-
          ities of a system. This is the foundation for
          what shall be or has been implemented.

       b) Architecture/Design - Overview of software.
          Includes relations to an environment and con-
          struction principles to be used in design of
          software components.

       c) Technical - Documentation of code, algorithms,
          interfaces, and APIs.

       d) End user - Manuals for the end-user, system
          administrators and support staff. 

   1.2 ManPages

       Contains a collection of man pages. A man page (short
       for manual page) is a form of online software docu-
       mentation usually found on a Unix or Unix-like oper-
       ating system. Topics covered include computer programs
       (including library and system calls), formal standards
       and conventions, and even abstract concepts.

       Categoies of man pages include:

       a) tsManPagesLibCLI
       b) tsManPagesLibGUI
       c) tsManPagesTestsLibCLI
       d) tsManPagesTestsLibGUI
       e) tsManPagesTestsToolsLibCLI
       f) tsManPagesTestsToolsLibGUI (Future)
       g) tsManPagesToolsCLI
       h) tsManPagesToolsGUI         (Future)
       i) tsManPagesUtilities        (Future) 

   1.3 Notebooks

       Contains a collection of commentaries that express
       opinions or offerings of explanations about events
       or situations that might be useful to Toolkit in-
       stallers, developers, operators, troubleshooters and
       distributors. The documents may be in Application-
       specific formats (Adobe PDF, JPEG Bit-mapped image,
       Microsoft Office, Plain text etc.).

       The collection includes:

       a) DeveloperDocuments (API-References-Pixel-Mode-
          wxPython and Developer-ReadMe-Files); and

       b) EngineeringDocuments (Product Marketing Documen-
          tation, Project Documentation and Technical Docu-
          mentation). 

   1.4 SourceDistributions

       Contains a collection of computer program source code
       files that the Toolkit recipient will need to re-
       create the Toolkit.

       The collection includes Developer-Sandbox and Site-Package
       versions of the following:

       1.4.1 tsWxGTUI_Py2x

             The source code files appropriate for use with
             Python 2.4-2.7.

       1.4.2 tsWxGTUI_Py3x

             The source code files appropriate for use with
             Python 3.0-3.4. These files are generated by
             converting their Python 2x counterparts with
             the 2to3 translation utility followed by debug-
             ging of unresolved syntax and type conversion
             issues.

       NOTES:

       a) With Linux, Mac OS X and Unix operating sys-
          tems one must have "root" or administrator
          privileges to write to the site-package lo-
          cation.

       b) If the user will not have permission to di-
          rectly access the Repository but has a need
          to know specific contents, the system ad-
          ministrator should copy the appropriate
          contents of the Documents, ManPages
          and Notenook directories into each
          Site-Package.

          The copies were not included in the distri-
          bution in order to:

          (1) avoid increasing the release development
              and qualification efforts; and

          (2) minimize the size of the downloadable
              "tar" and "zip" files.

       c) Users of third-party site-packages must
          explicitly import via its path from top-level
          package through lower-level packages to module:

               site-package.package.module

       d) Examples for Python 2.4-2.7 site-packages:

          from tsWxGTUI_Py2x.tsLibCLI import tsCxGlobals
          from tsWxGTUI_Py2x.tsLibCLI import tsPlatformRunTimeEnvironment
          from tsWxGTUI_Py2x.tsLibCLI import tsExceptions as tse
          from tsWxGTUI_Py2x.tsLibCLI import tsLogger

          from tsWxGTUI_Py2x.tsLibGUI import tsWx as wx

       d) Examples for Python 3.0-3.4 site-packages:

          from tsWxGTUI_Py3x.tsLibCLI import tsCxGlobals
          from tsWxGTUI_Py3x.tsLibCLI import tsPlatformRunTimeEnvironment
          from tsWxGTUI_Py3x.tsLibCLI import tsExceptions as tse
          from tsWxGTUI_Py3x.tsLibCLI import tsLogger

          from tsWxGTUI_Py3x.tsLibGUI import tsWx as wx
