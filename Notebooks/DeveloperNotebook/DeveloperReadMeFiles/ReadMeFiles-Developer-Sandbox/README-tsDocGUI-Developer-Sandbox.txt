====================== Toolkit Suffix ======================

1. Toolkit Suffix

   Each "tsWxGTUI" Toolkit distribution includes a root
   directory whose name ("tsWxGTUI") has a suffix "_PyVx"
   that reflects the associated Python language syntax
   version:

      "_Py2x" - Identifies second generation syntax
                associated with Python 2.6.6-2.7.6.

      "_Py3x" - Identifies third generation syntax
                associated with Python 3.2.0-3.2.5.

===============  Multi-Font Document Library ===============

2. Multi-Font Document Library

   Documentation, in a multi-font format with tables and
   graphical images, for each "tsWxGTUI" Toolkit distri-
   bution, is contained in the subdirectory named
   "./tsWxGTUI__PyVx/tsDocGUI".

   Though still drafts, these documents describe background
   technology, software engineering insight and operational
   details that could not be included in those plain text
   documents contained in "./tsWxGTUI__PyVx/tsDocCLI".

   The subdirectory is organized, by content format and
   topic as follows:

   1. Microsoft Word File Format:

      authoring tool and content management system for
      creating, maintaining, and distributing single-sourced
      content.

            file should be saved in "LibreOffice 4.2 Writer"
