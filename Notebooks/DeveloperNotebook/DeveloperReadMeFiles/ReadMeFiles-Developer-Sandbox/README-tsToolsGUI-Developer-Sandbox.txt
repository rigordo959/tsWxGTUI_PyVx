=================== PACKAGE ORGANIZATION ===================

1. Package Organization

  The collection of application programs for improving and
  tracking the productivity of software developers is
  organized, by the functional scope of each tool, into
  "packages". When appropriate, any package may import
  and use the services of any tsLibGUI or tsLibCLI package.
 
  Source code is contained in the associated ["src"] sub-
  directory. Depending on its complexity, the source code
  of a package may also be sub-divided and organized into
  a set of one or more source files.
 
  Unit/Integration Test code is contained in the associated
  ["test"] sub-directory. Depending on its complexity, the
  test code of a package may also be sub-divided and organ-
  ized into a set of one or more test files.

========================= PACKAGES =========================
