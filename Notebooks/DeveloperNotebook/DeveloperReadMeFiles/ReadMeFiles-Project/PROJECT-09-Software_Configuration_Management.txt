============= SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT ============

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

"Mercurial is a cross-platform, distributed revision control
tool for software developers. It is mainly implemented using
the Python programming language, but includes a binary diff
implementation written in C. It is supported on Windows and
Unix-like systems, such as FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Linux. Mer-
curial is primarily a command line program but graphical
user interface extensions are available. All of Mercurial's
operations are invoked as arguments to its driver program
hg, a reference to the chemical symbol of the element
mercury.

Mercurial's major design goals include high performance and
scalability, decentralized, fully distributed collaborative
development, robust handling of both plain text and binary
files, and advanced branching and merging capabilities,
while remaining conceptually simple.[3] It includes an
integrated web interface. Mercurial has also taken steps
to ease the transition for SVN users.

The creator and lead developer of Mercurial is Matt Mackall.
Mercurial is released as free software under the terms of
the GNU GPL v2 (or any later version[4])."
