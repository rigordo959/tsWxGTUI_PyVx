   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling on
   platforms with:

   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2
     or earlier GUI applications and character-mode 16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

================= APPLICAION LAUNCH MODULES ================

The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit povides the following
applicaion launch modules

1. "tsApplication.py" (a component of "tsLibCLI")

   Base class to initialize and configure the application
   program launched by an operator. It delivers those key-
   word-value pair options and positional arguments speci-
   fied by the operator, on the command line, and by the
   application, in its invocation parameter list. It ini-
   tializes any application specific logger(s). It enables
   an application launched via a Command Line Interface
   (CLI) to initialize, configure and use the same char-
   acter-mode terminal with a Graphical-style User Inter-
   face (GUI).

2. "tsCommandlineEnv.py" (a component of "tsLibCLI")

   Class, that uses "tsApplication" and wraps the Command
   Line Interface application with exception handlers to
   control exit codes and messages that may be used to
   coordinate other application programs. 

3. "tsWxMultiFrameEnv.py" (a component of "tsLibGUI")

   Class, that uses "tsCommandLineEnv" to launch and use
   the same character-mode terminal with a Graphical-style
   User Interface (GUI). It wraps the CLI, underlying the
   GUI, and the GUI with exception handlers to control the
   exit codes and messages used to coordinate other appli-
   cation programs.
