================== TOOLKIT TROUBLESHOOTING =================

5. Toolkit Troubleshooting

   The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit software is but one
   part of a complex system; a system whose multi-vendor
   computer hardware, operating system software and user ap-
   plication programs may be:

   a) components of a single local computer; or

   b) components distributed across a network of local and
      remote computers.

   The Toolkit troubleshooting guide is in the file at the
   following location:

   (e.g. "Technical_Preview")

     +-- ["$Documents"]
           |
           +-- "TROUBLESHOOT.txt"

============= TOOLKIT ENHANCEMENT & MAINTENANCE ============

6. Toolkit Enhancement & Maintenance

   The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit has been engineer-
   ed, developed and tested in accordance with established
   professional practices (MIL-STD-498), except as indicated
   below.

   The feasability prototype was developed by two experienced
   principal software engineering professionals.

   Subsequent development, leading to this Technical Preview
   edition, was by a single principal software engineering
   professional. Consequently, there have been:

   a) no formal design and code reviews;

   b) no independent unit-, integration- and system- level
      design verification testing; and

   c) no formal user acceptance testing
