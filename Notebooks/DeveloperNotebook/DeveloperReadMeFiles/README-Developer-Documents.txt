   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling on
   platforms with:

   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2
     or earlier GUI applications and character-mode 16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   This directory contains a collection of files which pro-
   vide the Toolkit Building Block, Tool and Application
   programner with an understanding of the design and usage
   of the Toolkit's CLI and GUI Application Programming In-
   terface.

   1.1 ["API-References-Pixel-Mode-wxPython"]

       The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit emulates a
       character-mode compatible subset of the popular
       wxPython API wrapper used by Python programmers to
       use the pixel-mode crossplatform Graphical User
       Interface which itself is implemented in C++.

       a) ["wxPython-2.8.9.2-docs"]

          The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit is in its
          pre-alpha stage of development. It emulates
          this now-obsolete version of the wxPython API.
  
       b) ["wxPython-3.0.2.0-docs"]

          This is the latest version of the pixel-mode
          wxWidgets and wxPython API.

          Based on feedback from users of the TeamSTARS
          "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit Technical Preview, the
          decision may be made to adopt the latest version
          before completing development.  

   1.2 ["DeveloperReadMeFiles"]

       The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit includes numer-
       ous directories and files. Copies of the directory
       readme files are collected in one directory for the
       convenience of both users and authors.
