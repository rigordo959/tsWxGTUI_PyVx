   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling on
   platforms with:

   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2
     or earlier GUI applications and character-mode 16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   Excerpt from www.Amazon.com:

   "Because they are often large and complex, GUI program-
   ming tool kits can be hard to use. wxPython is a combi-
   nation of the Python programming language and the
   wxWidgets toolkit, which allows programmers to create
   programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user
   interface, simply and easily. wxPython combines the power
   of an exceptionally complete user interface toolkit with
   an exceptionally flexible programming language. The
   result is a toolkit that is unique in the ease with which
   complex applications can be built and maintained.

   ""wxPython in Action"" is a complete guide to the
   wxPython toolkit, containing a tutorial for getting
   started, a guide to best practices, and a reference to
   wxPython's extensive widget set. After an easy intro-
   duction to wxPython concepts and programming practices,
   the book takes an in-depth tour of when and how to use
   the bountiful collection of widgets offered by wxPython.
   All features are illustrated with useful code examples
   and reference tables are included for handy lookup of
   an object's properties, methods, and events. The book
   enables developers to learn wxPython quickly and remains
   a valuable resource for futurework."

   Source code for examples used in the book are available
   for download from the book's publisher after it has been
   purchased.

2. ["API-References-Pixel-Mode-wxPython"]

   The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit emulates a
   character-mode compatible subset of the popular
   wxPython API wrapper used by Python programmers to
   use the pixel-mode crossplatform Graphical User
   Interface which itself is implemented in C++.

   a) ["wxPython-2.8.9.2-docs"]

      The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit is in its
      pre-alpha stage of development. It emulates
      this now-obsolete version of the wxPython API.

      Currently on-line is info about wxPython-2.8.12.
  
   b) ["wxPython-3.0.2.0-docs"]

      This is the latest version of the pixel-mode
      wxWidgets and wxPython API.

      Based on feedback from users of the TeamSTARS
      "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit Technical Preview, the
      decision may be made to adopt the latest version
      before completing development.
