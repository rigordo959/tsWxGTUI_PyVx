=========================== News ===========================

The pre-alpha release of the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx-0.0.0"
Toolkit is now available. It includes the following two
versions:

1. The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_Py2x-0.0.0" Toolkit is released
   for users of the popular, high-level, cross-platform,
   second generation Python 2.x programming language which
   is widely available.

   A wiki posting by the Python Software Foundation announc-
   ed that Python 3.0 was released in 2008. The final 2.x
   version 2.7 release came out in mid-2010, with a state-
   ment of extended support for this end-of-life release.
   The 2.x branch will see no new major releases after that.

   The source code and documentation is available for down-
   load at:

      http://pypi.python.org/pypi.

   It supports development and operation of:

   a. Command Line User Interface (CLI) application
      programs implemented in Python 2.0.0-2.7.9.

   b. Graphical-style User Interface (GUI) application
      programs implemented in Python 2.6.4-2.7.9.

2. The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_Py3x-0.0.0" Toolkit is released
   for users of the popular, high-level, cross-platform,
   third generation Python 3.x programming language which
   is growing in availability.

   A wiki posting by the Python Software Foundation announc-
   ed that Python 3.0 was released in 2008. 3.x is under
   active development and has already seen over five years
   of stable releases, including version 3.3 in 2012 and
   3.4 in 2014. This means that all recent standard library
   improvements, for example, are only available by default
   in Python 3.x.

   Guido van Rossum (the original creator of the Python
   language) decided to clean up Python 2.x properly,
   with less regard for backwards compatibility than is
   the case for new releases in the 2.x range. The most
   drastic improvement is the better Unicode support
   (with all text strings being Unicode by default) as
   well as saner bytes/Unicode separation.

   Besides, several aspects of the core language (such as
   print and exec being statements, integers using floor
   division) have been adjusted to be easier for newcomers
   to learn and to be more consistent with the rest of the
   language, and old cruft has been removed (for example,
   all classes are now new-style, "range()" returns a memory
   efficient iterable, not a list as in 2.x).

   The source code and documentation is available for down-
   load at:

      http://pypi.python.org/pypi.

   It supports development and operation of:

   a. Command Line User Interface (CLI) application
      programs implemented in Python 3.0.0-3.4.2.

   b. Graphical-style User Interface (GUI) application
      programs implemented in Python 3.1.5-3.4.2.
