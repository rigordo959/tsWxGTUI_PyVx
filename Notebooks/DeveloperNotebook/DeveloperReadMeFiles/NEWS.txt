==================== 13 August 2015 News ===================

The pre-alpha release of the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx-0.0.2"
Toolkit is available.

Modified Python 2x and 3x site-packages to now include copies
of the repository contents of the "Documents", "ManPages" and
"ProjectNotebook" directories. These directories and their
contents can now be included in the distribution of source
code created by the "python setup.py sdist" command.

Updated Python 2x and 3x site-packages setup.py and MANIFEST.in
to support "sdist" command in addition to the previous "build"
and "install" commands.

Updated CHANGE_LOG.txt, FAQ.txt and GETTING_STARTED.txt to
improve usability.

POSTSCRIPTS
=========== 

1. The Python Software Foundation's backporting of Python
   3.1-3.4 features to Python 2.7 makes it possible for
   adopters and users of the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Tool-
   kit to also use the Toolkit's Python 3x source code with
   later versions of Python 2.7. (This is similar to the
   backporting of Python 3.0 features to later versions of
   Python 2.6.)

2. The Python Software Foundation's Python Package Index
   (PyPI) contains a package named "SIX" which is a Python
   2 and 3 compatibility library. It provides utility func-
   tions for smoothing over the differences between Python
   versions with the goal of writing Python code that is
   compatible on both Python versions. It supports every
   Python version since 2.5. It is contained in only one
   Python file, so it can be easily copied into your pro-
   ject.

3. The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit author may eventu-
   ally apply "SIX" to expand the usability of the Toolkit
   with older Python versions. Currently, the Toolkit is
   focussed only on those popular, readily available plat-
   forms that can be emulated using hypervisor technology
   to run various Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and
   Unix distributions as guest operating systems on a late
   model computer with multi-core Intel processors. Attempts
   to build and use older versions of Python on the same
   Guest OS have been unsuccessful. The older Pythons work
   only in Command Line Interface mode. The Graphical User
   Interface mode cannot work because the older curses in-
   terfaces fail to build and the Toolkit author lacks the
   troubleshooting expertise. There is a suspicion that one
   cannot build an old Python curses interface package when
   the host platform only has a newer, incompatible curses
   or ncurses terminal interface library installed.

==================== 06 August 2015 News ===================

The pre-alpha release of the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx-0.0.1"
Toolkit is now available.

Updated README.txt, COPYRIGHT.txt and notebooks to improve
clarity, reflect new platforms and to include platform
usability considerations. 

===================== 08 July 2015 News ====================

The pre-alpha release of the TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx-0.0.0"
Toolkit is now available. It includes the following two
versions abd their associated variants (Python Distribution
Utilities ("Distutils") installable "Site-Packages" and non-
installable "Developer-Sandboxes" for enhancement and bug
fix development and experimentation without interference
with the already installed Site-Packages):

1. The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_Py2x-0.0.0" Toolkit is released
   for users of the popular, high-level, cross-platform,
   second generation Python 2.x programming language which
   is widely available.

   A wiki posting by the Python Software Foundation announc-
   ed that Python 3.0 was released in 2008. The final 2.x
   version 2.7 release came out in mid-2010, with a state-
   ment of extended support for this end-of-life release.
   The 2.x branch will see no new major releases after that.

   The source code and documentation is available for down-
   load at:

      http://pypi.python.org/pypi.

   It supports development and operation of:

   a. Command Line User Interface (CLI) application
      programs implemented in Python 2.0.0-2.7.9.

   b. Graphical-style User Interface (GUI) application
      programs implemented in Python 2.6.4-2.7.9.

2. The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_Py3x-0.0.0" Toolkit is released
   for users of the popular, high-level, cross-platform,
   third generation Python 3.x programming language which
   is growing in availability.

   A wiki posting by the Python Software Foundation announc-
   ed that Python 3.0 was released in 2008. 3.x is under
   active development and has already seen over five years
   of stable releases, including version 3.3 in 2012 and
   3.4 in 2014. This means that all recent standard library
   improvements, for example, are only available by default
   in Python 3.x.

   Guido van Rossum (the original creator of the Python
   language) decided to clean up Python 2.x properly,
   with less regard for backwards compatibility than is
   the case for new releases in the 2.x range. The most
   drastic improvement is the better Unicode support
   (with all text strings being Unicode by default) as
   well as saner bytes/Unicode separation.

   Besides, several aspects of the core language (such as
   print and exec being statements, integers using floor
   division) have been adjusted to be easier for newcomers
   to learn and to be more consistent with the rest of the
   language, and old cruft has been removed (for example,
   all classes are now new-style, "range()" returns a memory
   efficient iterable, not a list as in 2.x).

   The source code and documentation is available for down-
   load at:

      http://pypi.python.org/pypi.

   It supports development and operation of:

   a. Command Line User Interface (CLI) application
      programs implemented in Python 3.0.0-3.4.2.

   b. Graphical-style User Interface (GUI) application
      programs implemented in Python 3.1.5-3.4.2.
