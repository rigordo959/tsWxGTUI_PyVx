   The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit emulates a
   character-mode compatible subset of the popular
   wxPython API wrapper used by Python programmers to
   use the pixel-mode crossplatform Graphical User
   Interface which itself is implemented in C++.

   a) ["wxPython-2.8.9.2-docs"]

      The TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit is in its
      pre-alpha stage of development. It emulates
      this now-obsolete version of the wxPython API.
  
   b) ["wxPython-3.0.2.0-docs"]

      This is the latest version of the pixel-mode
      wxWidgets and wxPython API.

      Based on feedback from users of the TeamSTARS
      "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit Technical Preview, the
      decision may be made to adopt the latest version
      before completing development.
