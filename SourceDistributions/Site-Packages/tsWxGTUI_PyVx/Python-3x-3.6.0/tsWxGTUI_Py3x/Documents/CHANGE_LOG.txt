     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-

======================= Change Log =========================

    2015/08/26 rsg Updated contents of the "Documents" di-
                   rectory to reflect adoption of "GtHub"
                   repository hosting service for the Tool-
                   kit release and the associated review and
                   re-organization of the Toolkit release
                   itself.

    2015/08/26 rsg Updated "Change Log":

                   Reversed the log order to draw attention
                   to the most recent event by placing it
                   immediately below the change file header
                   and conversly drawing the least attention
                   to the oldest change by placing it directly
                   above the change file footer.

    2015/08/12 rsg Updated "Documents":

                   Modified "GETTING_STARTED.txt", in directory
                   "./tsWxGTUI_PyVx_Repository/Documents"
                   to include a section entitled "QUICK TEST DRIVE"
                   which offers curious but impatient prospective
                   adopters and users of the toolkit the means to
                   minimize the time and effort to experience the
                   look and feel of the toolkit after simply down-
                   loading it and extracting its contents into a
                   temporary deiectory.

                   Modified "FAQ.txt", in directory
                   "./tsWxGTUI_PyVx_Repository/Documents"
                   to include a section entitled "Alterative
                   Solutions" which offers curious but impatient
                   prospective adopters and users of the toolkit
                   the means to minimize the time and effort to 
                   discover the additional information buryied
                   within the extensive engineering notebook
                   collection.

    2015/08/11 rsg Updated "SourceDistributions:

                   Modified setup.py modules, in Python 2x and 3x
                   "SitePackages", to:

                   a) add support for Debian 8, Microsoft Windows
                      10 and OpenSUSE 13.2. 

                   b) update supported operating system versions 

    2015/08/11 rsg Updated "SourceDistributions:

                   Modified MANIFEST.in modules, in Python 2x and 3x
                   "SitePackages" for use during "python setup.py
                   sdist" operation to include contents of:

                      Documents
                      ManPages
                      ProjectNotebook.

    2015/08/10 rsg Updated "SourceDistributions:

                   Updated Python 2x and 3x "SitePackages" to
                   include copies from "./tsWxGTUI_PyVx_Repository"
                   of:

                      ./Documents
                      ./ManPages
                      ./Notebooks/ProjectNotebook.

    2015/06/23 rsg Modified "tsWxEventLoop" module to take
                   advantage of a recently discovered
                   "nCurses" feature that makes mouse input
                   available not just for xterm-family term-
                   inal emulators but also with vt100-family
                   ones, but only with the new "XTerm" and
                   "UXTerm" terminal application on Linux
                   operating system and with the "mintty"
                   terminal application on the Linux-based
                   Cygwin plugin for Microsoft Windows.

                   This eliminates the need for keyboard
                   shortcut "hot" key feature which is still
                   to be developed. However, processing
                   twelve instead of a single mouse input
                   event introduces a noticable delay in
                   response and precludes use of double or
                   triple button clicks.        

  2015/03/26 rsg Successfully ported copies of current
                 developer-sandboxes into installable site-
                 packages. Changes involved the tedious
                 tasks of:

                 a) Moving hundreds of building-block, tool
                    and test source code from separate devel-
                    oper-sandbox packages into appropriate
                    tsLibCLI, tsToolsCLI, tsToolsLibCLI,
                    tsLibGUI, tsToolsGUI and tsToolsLibGUI
                    site-package directories;

                 b) Editing hundreds of source code files to 
                    replace "try-except" logic around import
                    statements with "import from" site-pack-
                    age logic and substitute empty site-
                    package "__init__.py" files for complex
                    path generating logic in dozens of de-
                    veloper-packages.

                 c) Installing and debugging each site-
                    package on various host platforms.

                 d) Updating documentation to reflect both
                    the developer-sandbox and site-package
                    configurations.

  2014/11/21 rsg Resolved display anomaly issue with xterm-88color
                 and xterm-256color by application of the config-
                 uration control switch USE_256_COLOR_PAIR_LIMIT
                 so that these terminal emulators now behave like
                 their xterm-16color counterpart. This color pair
                 limitation technique was discovered in such
                 newer operating system releases as CentOS 7.0
                 Linux and Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).

  2014/04/05 rsg Removed deprecated packages and tools:

                 tsCommandLineParserPkg
                 tsConfigObjectPkg
                 tsDataBasePkg
                 tsDecoratorPkg
                 tsLibraryImport Tool
                 tsLinesOfCode Tool
                 tsPublish Tool
                 tsReImport Tool
                 tsReVersion Tool
                 tsThreadPoolPkg

  2014/04/04 rsg Added MANIFEST_TREE.sh to distribution and instal-
                 lation setup to generate text and html versions
                 of file manifest listing.

  2014/03/14 rsg Added MANIFEST.in to distribution and installation
                 setup that includes non-python files.

  2013/10/18 rsg Added logic to the tsApplication module to gather,
                 capture and log the tsPlatformRuntimeEnvironment
                 at each Python application launch in a manner
                 similar to the capture of GUI configuration by
                 the tsWxGraphicalTextUserInterface module at GUI
                 launch.

  2013/10/18 rsg Added tsGistGetTerminalSize.py module to the
                 tsUtilities package and to the configuration
                 gathering of the tsPlatformRuntimeEnvironment
                 package. It captures, reports and displays the
                 command line shell window size on Cygwin, Linux,
                 Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Unix.

  2013/10/21 rsg Added tsCxGlobals to tsLibCLI. It establishes
                 configuration constants and macro-type functions
                 for the Command Line Interface mode of the
                 "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit.
