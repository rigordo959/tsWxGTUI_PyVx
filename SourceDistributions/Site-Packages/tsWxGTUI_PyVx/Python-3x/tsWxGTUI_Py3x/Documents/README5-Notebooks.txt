   +----+----+  TeamSTARS "tsWxGTUI_PyVx" Toolkit
   | ts | Wx |      with Python 2x & Python 3x based
   +----+----+         Command Line Interface (CLI)
   | G T U I |      and "Curses"-based "wxPython"-style, 
   +---------+         Graphical-Text User Interface (GUI)
 
   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling on
   platforms with:

   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2
     or earlier GUI applications and character-mode 16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   You can find this and other plain-text files in the
   Toolkit subdirectory named:

       "./<Toolkit Recipient's Repository>/Documents".
