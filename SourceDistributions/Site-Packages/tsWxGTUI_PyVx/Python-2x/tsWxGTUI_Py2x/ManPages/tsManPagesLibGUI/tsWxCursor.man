DESCRIPTION
    tsWxCursor.py - Class to establish a cursor from a small bitmap.
    The cursor is usually used for denoting where the mouse pointer
    is, with a picture that might indicate the interpretation of a
    mouse click.

CLASSES
    tsWxObject.Object(__builtin__.object)
        Cursor
    
    class Cursor(tsWxObject.Object)
     |  A cursor is a small bitmap usually used for denoting where the mouse
     |  pointer is, with a picture that might indicate the interpretation of
     |  a mouse click.
     |  
     |  A single cursor object may be used in many windows (any subwindow type).
     |  The wxWindows convention is to set the cursor for a window, as in X,
     |  rather than to set it globally as in MS Windows, although a global
     |  wx.SetCursor function is also available for use on MS Windows.

     |      Bind with event and accelerator System and User tables.
     |      
     |      event: One of the EVT_* objects that specifies the
     |             the type of event to bind.
     |      
     |      handler: A callable object to be invoked when the event is
     |               delivered to self.  Pass None to disconnect an
     |               event handler.
     |      
     |      source: Sometimes the event originates from a different window
     |              than self, but you still want to catch it in self.  (For
     |              example, a button event delivered to a frame.)  By passing
     |              the source of the event, the event handling system is able
     |              to differentiate between the same event type from different
     |              controls.
     |      
     |      id: Used to specify the event source by ID instead of instance.
     |      
     |      id2: Used when it is desirable to bind a handler to a range of ids,
     |           such as with EVT_MENU_RANGE.

     |  Static methods inherited from tsWxObject.Object:
     |  
     |  tsGetCurrentId()
     |      Return latest ID.
     |  
     |  tsGetTheId(mySelf)
     |      Return the ID associated with this class instance.
     |  
     |  tsNewId()
     |      Create a unique ID.
     |      
     |      Remarks:
     |      Various controls and other parts of wxWidgets need an ID. Sometimes
     |      the ID may be directly provided by the user or have a predefined
     |      value, such as wxID_OPEN. Often, however, the value of the ID is
     |      unimportant and is created automatically by calling
     |      wxWindow::NewControlId or by passing wxID_ANY as the ID of an
     |      object.
     |      
     |      There are two ways to generate an ID. One way is to start at a
     |      negative number, and for each new ID, return the next smallest
     |      number. This is fine for systems that can use the full range of
     |      negative numbers for IDs, as this provides more than enough IDs
     |      and it would take a very very long time to run out and wrap
     |      around. However, some systems cannot use the full range of the
     |      ID value. Windows, for example, can only use 16 bit IDs, and
     |      only has about 32000 possible automatic IDs that can be
     |      generated by wxWindow::NewControlId. If the program runs long
     |      enough, depending on the program itself, using this first method
     |      would cause the IDs to wrap around into the positive ID range
     |      and cause possible clashes with any directly specified ID values.
     |      
     |      The other way is to keep track of the IDs returned by
     |      wxWindow::NewControlId and do not return them again until the
     |      ID is completely free and not being used by any other objects.
     |      This will make sure that the ID values do not clash with one
     |      another. This is accomplished by keeping a reference count for
     |      each of the IDs that can possibly be returned by
     |      wxWindow::NewControlId. Other IDs are not reference counted.
     |  
     |  tsRegisterId(usedId)
     |      Adjust latest ID to reflect specified new one.
