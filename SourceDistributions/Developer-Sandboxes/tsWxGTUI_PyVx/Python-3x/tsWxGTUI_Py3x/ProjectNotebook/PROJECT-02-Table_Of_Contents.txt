    tation to facilitate development of the Command Line
    Interface and Graphical-style User Interface.

    The Built-in Documentation Symbols are passed via a list
    of keyword-value pairs to the launch wrapper modules
    named "tsCommandLineEnv" and "tsWxMultiFrameEnv". 

16. PROJECT-16-Applicaion_Launch_Modules.txt

    Describes two Python modules used to launch Python
    application programs which use a Command Line Inter-
    face.
