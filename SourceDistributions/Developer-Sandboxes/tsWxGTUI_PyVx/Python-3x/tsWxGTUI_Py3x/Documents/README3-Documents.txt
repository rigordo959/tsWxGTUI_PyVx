   Get that cross-platform, pixel-mode "wxPython" feeling on
   platforms with:

   * 64-bit processors, nCurses 6.x, 64-bit Python 3.6.x or
     later GUI applications and character-mode 256-/16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   * 32-bit processors, nCurses 6.x/5.x, 32-bit Python 3.5.2
     or earlier GUI applications and character-mode 16-/8-
     color (xterm-family) and non-color (vt100-family)
     terminals and terminal emulators.

   You can find this and other plain-text files in the
   Toolkit subdirectory named:

       "./<Toolkit Recipient's Repository>/Documents".

         |     |     |  Since embedded systems typically do not
         |     |     |  have access to the engineering Notebooks,
         |     |     |  this directory contains a collection of
         |     |     |  files converted from:

         |     |     |
         |     |     |  The following files are usable on character-
         |     |     |  mode terminals having only a monospaced font
         |     |     |  of a single type and size (each conversion
         |     |     |  introduced its own formatting compromises).

         |     |     |  Lynx, the character-mode WEB browser and Hypertext
         |     |     |  Markup Language file viewer, produced the only
         |     |     |  conversion which retained information (but not the
         |     |     |  layout) originally appearing in tables.
